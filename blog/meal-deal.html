     Martin emerged from his local train station after a long, draining
day. All he wanted was to get home and collapse into bed. He hadn’t
eaten, and though he knew skipping dinner wasn’t a good plan, the
thought of cooking filled him with dread. He hurried down the stairs
straight into a crush of commuters spilling from the opposite platform.
Ordinarily mild-mannered people became a jostling mob, elbows out as
they forced their way through the ticket barriers. By the time Martin
squeezed through, his patience was at breaking point.
</p>

    border-radius:16px;
    margin:30px auto;
    display:block;
  "
/>
    <p>
     The next obstacle was the exit itself. With only one automatic door
working, more than a hundred people were funnelled through a single gap
like cattle at a gate. When he finally stumbled onto the street, Martin
was, quite understandably, in a very bad mood. One broken door had
turned an ordinary commute into chaos.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Shelter &amp; The Meal Deal
    </h2>
    <p>
     And then the rain began. First a few drops, then a steady drizzle,
and within half a minute a downpour that left him drenched. A
thunderclap split the air, confirming his day had reached new lows.
Desperate for shelter, he scanned the street and spotted his only
refuge, a “little Waitrose” glowing across the road. It was far too wet
to wait politely for the lights to change, so Martin took the
uncharacteristic risk of darting across two lanes of traffic, dodging
angry drivers and harried cyclists, until at last he reached the sliding
doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stumbled into the "little Waitrose" dripping wet and exhausted,
but his spirits were lifted as soon as he felt the burst of warm air hit
his face and body. Martin just wanted to stand under the hot air coming
from the ceiling and dry himself off, but he knew that would look both
strange and suspicious, and he didn't fancy having to explain himself to
the rather intimidating looking security guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he decided to start wandering casually around the shop, pretending
to be a genuine shopper. That was when he remembered he still needed
dinner, and what better way to end a busy day than with a lovely
nutritious Meal Deal - sandwich, packet of crisps and drink all for the
bargain price of £5. Martin slowly made his way to the front of the shop
where the sandwiches were stacked inside big refrigerator cabinets. It
may have been an exaggeration to say that there were hundreds of
different options to choose from, but he was pretty certain he could
have a Meal Deal every day for a month without having to eat the same
sandwich twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin started to search through all the different sandwich options,
and it didn't take long before Martin found something he fancied. Martin
was a creature of habit, and in his personal sandwich hierarchy the
classic ham and mustard was top. The next choice he had to make was
which crisps would best accompany the ham and mustard sandwich.
Fortunately, they were stacked conveniently beside the sandwiches,
saving him the bother of a long search. Martin went straight to the
pickled onion Monster Munch knowing this would be an excellent
accompaniment to the ham and mustard sandwich. And finally the drink -
he settled on a bottle of sparkling water reasoning that the bubbles
would cut through the saltiness of the crisps and make him feel ever so
slightly more virtuous about his otherwise unhealthy snack.
    </p>
    <p>
     With his Meal Deal complete, Martin took his time to make his way to
the check out. It was still raining and he was in no hurry to get back
outside into the wet. As he was approaching the tills he made a sudden
decision to grab a banana, quite correctly reasoning he needed to add
some vitamins to his heavily processed dinner. It was only a short
detour to get to the fruit section and within minutes he was in
possession of a nicely ripened banana to go alongside his sandwich,
crisps and drink. When he got to the self-checkout there were only two
other people in front of him which he took to be a good omen for the
rest of his evening. It wasn't long before he had reached the front of
the queue and making his way to the next available check out.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Checkout Dilemma
    </h2>
    <p>
     He placed his basket on the bagging area and looked at the screen in
front of him and read the prompt:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Press Start or Scan First Item.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin frowned. Why both options? Surely the act of scanning an item
was enough to start the process. This was exactly the kind of thing that
bothered Martin. He had a passion (some might say an affliction) for
process and order. Every daily interaction, whether it's buying a
Vanilla Latte at Starbucks or queuing for stamps at the Post Office was
seen through the critical lens of someone who must have order in their
life. In fact, just the other day he was in the pub waiting to be served
thinking to himself that a ticketing system would be much more efficient
and less stressful for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, he quickly dismissed this as unimportant and began to scan his
food and place them in the bagging area. The sandwich beeped through,
then the crisps, and then the sparkling water. So far, flawless, no
unexpected items in the bagging area.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Banana Fiasco
    </h2>
    <p>
     All that remained was the banana. Martin knew the fruit drill - press
Look Up Item on the touch screen, select Fruit &amp; Vegetables, tap the
picture of a banana, and enter the quantity. But something was wrong.
The option wasn’t there. He stared at the screen, brain fog creeping in,
thoughts clouding until panic began to set in. He saw an assistant
standing by the door and waved madly at her hoping to get her attention.
After a few seconds she spotted him and came rushing over clearly
fearing he was in serious trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How can I help you?” she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry to bother you,” Martin stammered, “but I can’t find the
Fruit &amp; Vegetables option on the screen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The shop assistant smiled warmly and reassured Martin that this was
quite normal and he needed to go and weigh his fruit on the scales near
the entrance to the shop. Martin picked up his banana and started the
short walk towards the weighing scales at the front of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before he got more than a few steps, a curt voice called after
him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't leave your shopping there", the voice said sharply. Martin
turned round to be confronted by the previously friendly shop
assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I'm just going to weigh the banana", he said flustered. "I'll
only be a couple of minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
     “That may be true,” she replied firmly, “but you’re blocking the
checkout.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin was in no mood to argue over such a triviality, so he started
to put all his shopping back into his basket and return to the weighing
scales. He thought to himself that by the time he’d packed it all away,
he could have weighed the banana and returned. Not that the assistant,
he suspected, would appreciate the efficiency of that observation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin weighed his banana, stuck the label on the outside and trudged
back to the checkouts. By the time he returned the queue had got longer
and there were now eight people in front of him. Infuriated barely
covered it. Still, he forced himself to stay calm and wait his turn.
Eventually he was back in front of the till ready to start rescanning.
He ignored the "Press Start or Scan First Item" button and went straight
to scanning. Every item went through first time. No need to try scanning
the barcodes at different angles, no unexpected items in the bagging
area. And he avoided the dreaded age verification process which could
add minutes to an otherwise perfect transaction. Now all he needed to do
was pay.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Loyalty Loops &amp; Bag Prompts
    </h2>
    <p>
     He pressed the "Pay For Items" button only to be confronted by
another detour: Do you have a loyalty card?. Martin selected "No" and
got ready to tap his credit card on the payment machine when yet another
message appeared - How many bags have you used?. Martin sighed. He
always carried his trusty foldable bag, so he selected no bags and then
"Enter". Finally, the screen moved on… but not to payment. One last
decision: Cash or card?
    </p>
    <p>
     “No brainer” he muttered, "who carries cash in 2025?".
    </p>
    <p>
     He gave the chip &amp; pin machine a quick tap with his card, and the
transaction was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin bundled his ham and mustard sandwich, Monster Munch crisps and
sparkling water into his bag, and stepped back out into the pouring
rain.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Dropped Banana
    </h2>
    <p>
     Martin stepped out of the sliding doors, clutching his hard-won Meal
Deal and banana, feeling almost victorious after the ordeal at the
checkout. The rain was still pouring, bouncing off the pavement and
soaking him through within seconds. He fumbled with his foldable
shopping bag, trying to rearrange his purchases to avoid the Monster
Munch from getting crushed under the bottle of water, and the sandwich
from getting soggy from the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his eagerness to juggle everything properly into place, Martin’s
fingers slipped. The banana flew from his grasp in slow motion, bounced
once on the wet pavement, and then rolled underneath a speeding car
which proceeded to squash it into the road. Martin froze. He stared at
the yellow mess now stuck to the tarmac. All that effort to get his
prized banana was utterly wasted. People brushed past him, umbrellas
knocking against his shoulder, but all he could think about was his
ruined Meal Deal - the nutritious banana that had been carefully chosen
to offset the junk food.
    </p>
    <p>
     He glanced up in despair, only to spot a glimmer of hope glowing
faintly through the sheets of rain. Across the street, like a guiding
star calling to him, was the neon sign of a Boots pharmacist. It might
not have been his first choice, but desperate times required desperate
measures and he wasn’t about to let one unfortunate accident ruin his
dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, ignoring the thunder overhead and the annoyed drivers honking as
he dashed across the road, Martin tightened his grip on the bag and
marched towards the chemist doors.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Sun Blush Pesto Salad
    </h2>
    <p>
     The sliding doors whooshed open and Martin stumbled into the bright,
fluorescent glow of Boots. The sweet scent of the perfume counter was a
pleasant change to the damp smell of wet clothes, and he found it a
comforting welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin made his way past endless rows of shampoo, toothpaste, and
plasters, until he reached the modest chilled cabinet tucked away at the
back. He had always thought it odd that a pharmacy also sold food, but
in this moment he was profoundly grateful. There, waiting for him, was a
neat row of sandwiches and salads, each one packaged in a plastic
container.
    </p>
    <p>
     He searched the shelves, hunting for something that could take the
place of his lost banana. And it took only a moment for him to find the
perfect replacement - the Sun Blush Pesto Salad. The label told him that
it contained red tomatoes, olive oil, pasta spirals coated in vivid
green pesto, and a sprinkling of feta cheese. This was Martin's idea of
a perfect companion to his ham &amp; mustard sandwich – much better than
a banana.
    </p>
    <p>
     He picked the salad up and looked for the self-service tills. He
could see them at the front of the shop and began to retrace his steps
back past the perfume counter, the floral mist clinging to his damp
jacket giving it a much-needed fresh fragrance. A small group of
teenagers blocked the aisle, comparing nail polish colours, oblivious to
Martin trying to get past. Martin shuffled restlessly, shifting from
foot to foot, before squeezing past with an exaggerated sigh - a
performance wasted on the oblivious teenagers.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he drew nearer to the tills, he couldn’t help but perform his
usual mental audit. The layout, in his view, was nothing short of
chaotic. The tills were spread out resulting in people forming multiple
queues, unsure when it was their turn to move forward. Boots hadn’t yet
learned from the efficiency of banks and airports, where a single,
snaking queue fed into multiple service points with seamless
precision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin clutched his bag tightly, balancing the Sun Blush Pesto Salad
in his other hand, and took his place behind a man juggling two meal
deals and a precariously large briefcase. Each queue shuffled forward at
different speeds, causing Martin to question whether he had joined the
fastest line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin inched along until finally it was his turn. He stepped up to
the empty checkout, placed his salad down, and immediately found himself
confronted by a design flaw that to him was nothing short of
catastrophic. The checkout had two flat areas: one to the left, and one
to the right. But which was for placing the basket, and which was for
scanned items?
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no signs, no arrows, nothing. He hesitated for a moment
and sensed the impatient glare of a large man holding a wet umbrella
waiting in the queue. In the end Martin made what he thought was a
logical deduction and placed his basket on the larger space, keeping the
smaller square for scanned goods. A sensible decision, though he
strongly suspected at least half the people in the shop would have done
it the other way around.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Advantage Card Paradox
    </h2>
    <p>
     He scanned the Sun Blush Pesto Salad and it registered with a
re-assuring beep. He placed the plastic container in the bagging area
and pressed the payment button. Everything was going perfectly…until the
screen froze and presented him with two options:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Please Present Advantage Card
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      a) I have forgotten my card
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      b) I don’t have an Advantage Card
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin frowned. This was a paradox. If you actually had a card, there
was no button to press. He could see, out of the corner of his eye,
another shopper at the next till prodding the screen helplessly,
muttering in frustration. People with cards stood frozen, convinced they
had to declare themselves as either forgetful or cardless. The whole
system was broken - a logical muddle that would have made even Alan
Turing shake his head in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin sighed. This was the part that had confused him before. He
remembered standing here months ago, trying the different options like
everyone else, until finally a staff member had explained the hidden
trick: if you actually had an Advantage Card, you weren’t supposed to
touch the screen at all - you simply scanned it. No instruction, no
hint, nothing to tell you this was the way forward. He fished his card
from his wallet and swiped it confidently, taking secret pleasure in
knowing the correct sequence where others would surely flounder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The screen blinked, and shifted smoothly to the payment page. For
once, Martin almost smiled. He tapped his debit card against the machine
with a sense of triumph, exhaled in relief as it approved, and picked up
his salad. Behind him, he could already hear the umbrella man muttering
at the Advantage Card screen, destined to make the same mistake Martin
had made last time.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Exploding Sparkling Water
    </h2>
    <p>
     Martin finally stepped back out into the storm, clutching his bag
containing the ham and mustard sandwich, the Monster Munch, and the Sun
Blush Pesto Salad. He tightened his grip as the rain pelted down even
harder and decided to take a quick sip from his sparkling water before
trudging home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment he twisted the cap, a violent hiss escaped and the bottle
erupted like a volcano. A fountain of fizzy water sprayed over his face,
his coat, and worst of all - straight into his bag. Droplets seeped into
the flimsy plastic sandwich container, soaking the bread until you could
see it start to disintegrate like papier-mâché left out in the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stood in disbelief, staring down at the carnage. The sandwich was
ruined. Martin realised he had no choice. He would have to replace the
sandwich, and perhaps everything else. He looked around through the
curtain of rain and spotted the glowing sign of yet another shop - a
Tesco Express tucked between a betting shop and a shuttered vape store.
With a resigned sigh, Martin braced himself for yet another ordeal,
tightened his hood, and darted across the road (narrowly avoiding a
delivery van blasting its horn) towards his third shopping expedition of
the evening.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Tesco Redemption
    </h2>
    <p>
     Inside, Tesco was at least warm and mercifully dry. The strip lights
buzzed faintly overhead, and the faint scent of freshly baked bread
lingered in the air. The biggest challenge wasn’t the staff or the
queues, but simply navigating the place. The aisles were narrow and
cluttered, and the extra width taken up by his shopping basket meant he
was constantly bumping into stacked displays and the occasional passing
shopper. Every few steps Martin had to shuffle sideways to squeeze past
trolleys left half-abandoned, or dodge a stack of promotional boxes that
seemed deliberately placed in the middle of the walkway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, he made steady progress. He reached the chilled section, where
the shelves were bare but not empty. After some rummaging, he found a
chicken and bacon sandwich that looked surprisingly tasty. He spotted a
small basket of slightly bruised bananas near the end of the aisle. He
examined them carefully and selected the least battered one, he felt
good being back in possession of a banana!
    </p>
    <p>
     With his shopping complete, Martin wound his way back through the
obstacle course of narrow aisles and found himself at the self-checkout
area. There was no long queue, just a couple of people ahead of him, and
the machines looked reassuringly familiar. He knew that Tesco had
cleverly perfected the art of the self-service system. The screens were
simple, the prompts logical, and the bagging areas rarely triggered the
dreaded “unexpected item” warning. This was a model of efficiency. For
once, Martin felt almost at ease, confident that he could glide through
the process without incident.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin scanned his chicken and bacon sandwich first, the familiar
“beep” lifting his mood after the chaotic evening he’d endured. The
bruised banana followed, registering on the screen with reassuring ease.
For once, there was no drama, no need to navigate endlessly around on
the screen, no confusing menus about fruit and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, nothing else. His shopping was complete. Unlike the
prolonged process at Waitrose or the Advantage Card trap at Boots, Tesco
had perfected the system. No redundant button to press, no hidden menu
waiting to trip him up. The moment he’d scanned his last item, the
payment reader lit up and he just needed to tap and go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martin pulled out his debit card with a flicker of relief, tapped it
against the glowing terminal, and heard the sharp, approving beep. That
was, in Martin’s mind, a self-checkout at its best - fast, efficient,
and a logical design.
    </p>
    <p>
     He slipped the purchases into his bag, the sandwich sitting carefully
above the banana, and walked with quiet determination through the
sliding Tesco doors.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Final Walk
    </h2>
    <p>
     Outside, the storm had lessened to a drizzle. The road glistened
under the streetlamps, and the air carried the fresh scent of rain on
tarmac. Martin pulled his hood tight and started the refreshing walk
home, gripping the bag as though it contained treasure rather than a
simple sandwich, salad and a battered piece of fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
     It struck him then that the whole evening - three shops, one argument
with a shop assistant, a drowned sandwich, a lost banana, and a
sparkling-water explosion, had been a battle of endurance. Yet here he
was, victorious. A man in possession of dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he turned the final corner to his street, Martin let out a breath
he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. For all its absurdities, for all
its trials and setbacks, he was heading home with food. And tomorrow,
perhaps, things would run more smoothly. Tonight, though, he allowed
himself a quiet victory - proof that even the smallest wins are worth
celebrating.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, Martin was triumphant.
